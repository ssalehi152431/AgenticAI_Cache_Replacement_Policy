Without Persona Prompt

Build Prompt

  f"Consider the following C++ scripts as your reference as these policies were able to get a high cache hit rates. Now, generate a new cache replacement policy code to yield a improved cache hit rate as .cpp file.\n"
            f"ONLY output the C++ code inside a single```cpp code blocks```.\n\n")

Fix Code Prompt

f"You previously generated the following C++ code:\n"
            f"```cpp\n{faulty_code}\n```\n\n"
            f"When compiling or running this code, the following error occurred:\n"

Improve Hit Rate Prompt

f"You previously generated the following C++ code for cache replacement policy:\n"
            f"```cpp\n{code}\n```\n\n"
            f"It results in a normalized cache hit rate of {hit_rate}.\n"
            f"ONLY output the modified C++ code inside a single ```cpp code block```."

Fix Timeout Prompt
 f"You previously generated the following C++ code for cache replacement policy:\n"
